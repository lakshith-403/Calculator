# Calculator

I was bored and made this on a late night. Just wanted to test if i can do this. So there are lots of limitations and bugs.
This only works with Integers but can be improved very easily.

I tried my best to organize files but the code is alot messy. Recently i started to fixing bugs but even i can't understand my own code. I'm going to leave this and start again from scratch. (when i have some free time probably after a year)

Feel free to explore :)
